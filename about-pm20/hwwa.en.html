origin of the press archives at the Hamburg Institute of International
Economics (HWWA)</h1>
<p>In 1908, the Hamburg Colonial Institute was established. This marks
the beginning of the history of the HWWA and its press archives. The
purpose of the Colonial Institute was</p>
<ul>
<li>To offer tertiary education for officials of the Reichskolonialamt
(Imperial Colonial Office) and other authorities, but also for
individuals from different professions such as merchants, farmers,
teachers and missionaries who intended to go to the so-called
protectorates (colonies) in Africa, Asia and the Pacific;</li>
<li>To create a central agency where all scientific colonial efforts
could be concentrated, i.e. the collection and evaluation of information
material about German and foreign colonies which was gathered from
newspapers, journals and research reports and made available to the
Colonial Institute’s teachers and students as well as to businessmen.
This was the nucleus of the HWWA and its library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the ever growing demand of Hamburg’s business community
and the Institute’s teachers and students for information about global
business, politics and society, the original thematical limitation to
German colonies and other overseas countries was abandoned. The archive
now covered the whole world.</p>
<p>When the archived material reached a critical mass, Heinrich Waltz,
the head of the archive at the time, invented the “Hamburg System” in
1911. It was used, with slight modifications, until 1998. Themes,
products and country designations were structured with classifications
and notations. These notations were assigned to individual press
articles, thus indicating their content. Articles were filed
chronologically within a given notation which also served as shelf mark
for the physical dossiers.</p>
<p>The Colonial Institute was wound up after the First World War when
Germany lost its colonies. The Institute was transformed into the
University of Hamburg in 1919; and the Central Agency became the
“Hamburg Institute of International Economics”. Its new mission was to
collect economic-empirical information and make it available to
Hamburg’s business community. In 1928, the press archives already
utilised more than 50 national and international newspapers and more
than 100 specialist journals. The archives grew by approx. 1,200
clippings every day.</p>
<p>From 1908 until 1998 the press archives contained four
sub-archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest is the so-called “country archive” or “subjects archive”
which covers national and international economic topics (economics,
business studies, economic policy, industries, innovations) and
politics, environment and society.</li>
<li>The “company archive” contains material about national and foreign
companies (and holds a large number of annual reports besides the press
clippings).</li>
<li>The “wares archive” collects articles about products, i.e. raw
materials, semi-finished and finished products, their markets and
trading worldwide.</li>
<li>The “persons archive” contains press clippings about important
personalities from business, politics, academia and society.</li>
</ul>
