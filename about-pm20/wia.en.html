Economic Archive of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy</h1>
<p>The Economic Archive (WiA) was created in 1914 as the first
information department of the newly founded Institute for Maritime
Traffic and the World Economy. It provided information about economic
activities all over the world from the daily and weekly press. The
collections from 1914-1920 were lost during the Second World War; of the
other holdings only those parts are left which were microfilmed or
digitised.</p>
<p>After the First World War, the collection was reorganised and a new
classification system developed. This collection started in 1920.
Articles were sorted by geographic regions and countries, within these
countries by subjects that were subdivided, and then sorted
chronologically within the subdivisions. The focus was on economics and
business, but related fields such as politics, science and culture were
also taken into consideration to allow a full documentation of the
countries. The collection was strongly oriented towards research and
teaching at the Kiel Institute which explains some of the collection
focuses.</p>
<p>The subject collection until 1945 is available completely on
microfilm. Material about Germany is available on microfilm for the
entire existence of the archive. Some industrial countries and regions
are also available on microfilm. During the joint digitisation project
of the HWWA and the Kiel Institute, the first 700 raw microfilms and
some of the dossiers on persons held in Kiel were included and are
accessible.</p>
