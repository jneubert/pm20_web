# Press archives holdings

- Documents - newspaper articles, brochures, annual reports - are only summarized as such in the prepared dossiers, with content indexing and copyright classification. The dossiers (= folders) are published [here](https://pm20.zbw.eu/folder/about.en.html) on the web.
- The unprocessed material consists of digital copies of [micro film images](../../film) with two pages each, created in the 1960s and 1980s, respectively. ([Example](/film/h1/sh/S0690H) from folder "Land ownership and policies, home ownership, in British India.")
- The total digitized holdings amount to just under one million prepared documents (with a good 2 million document pages) as well as a total of 8.8 million unprepared pages. Furthermore, about 10 million document pages are available on microfiche.
- For copyright reasons, all materials published less than 70 years ago can only be viewed in the ZBW reading room. This also applies to individual articles with named authors not known to have died before that time in the prepared dossiers.
